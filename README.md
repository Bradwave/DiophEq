## DiophEq
### A geometric interpretation of the Diophantine equation

This is a very simple web-based JavaScript application, available at [bradwave.github.io/DiophEq](https://bradwave.github.io/DiophEq).

It is a interactive visualization and geometric interpretation of the _**Diophantine equation**_ <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=ax+by=c">.\
The value of the _coefficients_ <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=a">, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=b"> and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=c"> can be changed by the user.

The _line_ corresponding to <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=ax+by=c"> has equation
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=y = - \dfrac{a}{b} + \dfrac{c}{b}">
and it's represented on the Cartesian plane.

_**Integer solutions**_ to the Diophantine equation are represented as _red dots_ on said line.

The user can also move in the Cartesian plane by dragging to translate or scrolling to adjust the zoom level.

### Objective

This software is part of a project for the course _Matematiche Elementari dal Punto di Vista Superiore_ ("Elementary Mathematics from the Superior Point of View") from the _Master Degree in Mathematics_ of the _University of Turin_, Italy.

It has an **educational** and **didactic purpose**.
It is meant to be used as a tool for a set of High School lessons. Students are required to experiment with the software, come up with conjecture and observation and later interact with the software code in order to implement theory results.
